# Preview Controls Test Results

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Incorrect "of X" Display
**Problem**: Line 118 showed "of {numberOfRecipients}" instead of total available recipients
**Fix**: Changed to "of {selectedRecipients.length}" to show total available recipients
**Test**: With 5 recipients, input shows "Generate previews for 3 of 5"

### ✅ Issue 2: Navigation Counter Accuracy  
**Problem**: Navigation showed "X of numberOfRecipients" instead of generated count
**Fix**: Added `generatedCount` state to track actual previews generated
**Test**: Generate 3 of 5 recipients → Navigation shows "1 of 3", "2 of 3", "3 of 3"

### ✅ Issue 3: Arrow Navigation Bounds
**Problem**: Right arrow used `numberOfRecipients` instead of `generatedCount` for max bound
**Fix**: Updated both arrow buttons to use `generatedCount` for proper bounds
**Test**: Generate 2 recipients → Right arrow disabled at "2 of 2"

### ✅ Issue 4: State Reset on New Generation
**Problem**: Previous generation state persisted when starting new generation
**Fix**: Added state reset in `handleGenerateForSelected` and when recipients change
**Test**: Generate 3, then generate 2 → Properly resets to "1 of 2"

### ✅ Issue 5: Input Validation Edge Cases
**Problem**: Poor handling of empty input, NaN values, and invalid ranges
**Fix**: Enhanced onChange and added onBlur validation
**Test Cases**:
- Empty input → Auto-corrects to 1
- Negative numbers → Auto-corrects to 1  
- Numbers > total → Auto-corrects to max
- Non-numeric input → Auto-corrects to 1

### ✅ Issue 6: Index Out of Bounds
**Problem**: CurrentRecipientIndex could exceed generated count after new generation
**Fix**: Added useEffect to reset index when out of bounds
**Test**: Navigate to recipient 5, then generate only 3 → Auto-resets to recipient 1

## Verified Working Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: Channel Mode
- Shows simple "Generate" button
- No recipient selection needed
- Clean interface

### ✅ Scenario 2: No Recipients Selected  
- Shows error state with configuration prompt
- "Configure Recipients" button works

### ✅ Scenario 3: Single Recipient
- Shows "Generate previews for 1 of 1"
- After generation: "Browse: John Smith 1 of 1"
- Both arrows disabled (only one recipient)

### ✅ Scenario 4: Multiple Recipients - Generate All
- Shows "Generate previews for 5 of 5" (all selected by default)
- After generation: Navigation through all 5 recipients
- Arrows work correctly with proper bounds

### ✅ Scenario 5: Multiple Recipients - Generate Subset
- Change input to 3, generate
- Navigation limited to "1 of 3", "2 of 3", "3 of 3"
- Cannot navigate beyond generated count

### ✅ Scenario 6: Input Field Functionality
- Fully clickable and editable
- Real-time validation
- Auto-correction on invalid input
- Proper blur handling

### ✅ Scenario 7: Arrow Positioning
- Arrows stay fixed on far right
- No jumping when name lengths change
- Consistent positioning

### ✅ Scenario 8: 2-Column Layout
- Left: Generation controls
- Right: Navigation (after generation)
- Clean, uncluttered design
- No card borders

## Expected Functionality Verification

✅ **Initial State**: Correct display for all modes
✅ **Generation Flow**: Proper state transitions
✅ **Navigation Flow**: Accurate bounds and counters  
✅ **Input Validation**: Robust edge case handling
✅ **State Management**: Clean resets between generations
✅ **UI Layout**: Fixed positioning and responsive design

## Summary

All major issues have been identified and fixed. The preview controls now work as expected with:
- Accurate counters showing generated vs total recipients
- Proper navigation bounds limited to generated previews  
- Robust input validation with auto-correction
- Clean state management with proper resets
- Fixed arrow positioning that doesn't jump
- 2-column layout without card design

The functionality is now comprehensive and handles all edge cases properly.
